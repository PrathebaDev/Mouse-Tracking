# Mouse-Tracking
This is a project that I am currently working on, Interactive project simulating a game environment, where the user's mouse movements are monitored to follow a specified object.
Advanced CAPTCHA System
This project implements an innovative CAPTCHA system that challenges users to track the trajectory of a moving object within an interactive game-like interface. By analyzing the user's mouse movements, the system can effectively distinguish between human and bot interactions.

How it works:

Object Movement: An object moves along a curved path on the screen.
User Interaction: Users must trace the object's path using their mouse, aiming for accuracy.
Data Collection: The system records the user's mouse movements, including the path traced and the time taken to complete the task.
AI/ML Analysis: AI/ML models analyze the collected data to identify patterns that differentiate human and bot behavior. Humans tend to take more time and trace a less linear path, while bots often exhibit faster and more linear movements.
Decision Making: Based on the analysis, the system determines whether the user is a human or a bot.
